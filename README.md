# Machine-Learning-Application-Automated-Operation-Mode-Classification
Build a machine learning classification model to automatically classify the operation mode of a production line
In order to better understand the failure modes of the process step we performed an experiment at a laboratory facility. A failure mode, for example, can be slow opening of the gripper or applying too much force compared to normal operation. We were able to force different failure modes and generate a balanced dataset of ordinary operation and four different failure modes. Our goal now is to build a machine learning model to classify different modes of operation. We have considered the following modes of operation:
