# Machine-Learning-Application-Automated-Operation-Mode-Classification

In order to better understand the failure modes of the process step we performed an experiment at a laboratory facility. A failure mode, for example, can be slow opening of the gripper or applying too much force compared to normal operation. We were able to force different failure modes and generate a balanced dataset of ordinary operation and four different failure modes. Our goal now is to build a machine learning model to classify different modes of operation. We have considered the following modes of operation:

    1 - Normal operation
    2 - Slow opening of the grippers
    3 - The motor has too high velocity
    4 - The motor applies too much force when placing the component
    5 - The component was rotated by 90 degrees before assembly


1 - In the first step, I suggest, implement, and evaluate the performance of an algorithm to classify different modes of operation and failure types that are induced in the experiment.

2 - As mentioned, the data provided here was gathered through a test experiment by intentionally inducing some failure modes. The number of runs for different modes of operation are more or less similar. In a real assembly line, the data mainly comes from the normal modes of operation as failure modes are rare. Moreover, we do not exactly know what kind of failures occur and with what characteristics they occur.             
So I discussed around how the above issues can affect my proposed method and suggestions going about solving this problem.
